@DarshilParmar,"EDIT:
Elon Musk ruined the API part, you can use some other APIs

Here's one of the subscriber built the same project using other APIs - https://chenmeiqiao.notion.site/How-I-Reach-Out-to-YouTubers-I-Like-As-A-Data-Engineer-c37bdddefde54c3789229ffa5a789432

or you can use a static dataset from Kaggle and then use Airflow to process it
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmmarchetti/tweets-dataset

FAQ:
1. Twitter removed free access: It still has free access but with limits of requests you can make - https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api

2. You need to request for V2 access: You will get an error but just by reading the doc you should be able to access Elevated Access
