# Airflow_ETL
End-To-End Data Engineering Project
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering workflow utilizing Airflow, Python, and AWS services. The project involves extracting data from the YouTube API, transforming the data using Python scripts, deploying the workflow on Airflow/EC2, and saving the final result on Amazon S3.

Overview
The project aims to showcase a comprehensive data engineering pipeline, covering the following key aspects:

Data Extraction: Utilizing the YouTube API to extract relevant data, such as video metrics, comments, or channel information.
Data Transformation: Employing Python scripts to perform data transformation tasks, including cleaning, aggregating, and enriching the extracted data.
Workflow Orchestration: Using Apache Airflow to orchestrate the entire data engineering workflow, scheduling tasks, and managing dependencies.
Deployment: Deploying the workflow on an EC2 instance to ensure scalability and reliability.
Data Storage: Saving the transformed data onto Amazon S3, a scalable and durable cloud storage solution.

Getting Started
To run the data engineering pipeline locally, follow these steps:

Set Up Environment:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install Python dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure Credentials:
Obtain API credentials for accessing the YouTube API and AWS services.
Update the necessary credentials in the Python scripts (extract_data.py, transform_data.py) and Airflow DAG (youtube_etl.py).
Run Data Pipeline:
Start the Airflow scheduler and webserver.
Trigger the youtube_etl DAG to execute the data engineering pipeline.
Monitor Workflow:
Monitor the progress and status of the workflow in the Airflow UI.
View Results:
Once the workflow completes successfully, verify the transformed data stored on Amazon S3.
