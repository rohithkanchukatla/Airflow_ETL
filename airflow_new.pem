To download a .pem file from AWS, you typically use the AWS Management Console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). Here's a step-by-step guide for both methods:

Using AWS Management Console:
Sign in to the AWS Management Console: Go to the AWS Management Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in to your AWS account.
Navigate to EC2 Dashboard: From the services menu, select EC2 to access the EC2 Dashboard.
Select Key Pairs: In the EC2 Dashboard, locate the "Network & Security" section in the left navigation pane, then click on "Key Pairs".
Create or Locate Existing Key Pair: If you have an existing key pair, you can select it from the list. If not, click "Create Key Pair" and follow the prompts to create a new key pair. Make sure to choose the .pem format.
Download the .pem File: After creating or selecting the key pair, click on the "Download Key Pair" button. This will download the .pem file to your local machine.
